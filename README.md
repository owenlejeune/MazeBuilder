# Maze Builder

A small android application for building
and solving mazes using Threads and ASync
Tasks

### Development Environment
* Android Studio 3.0.1
* MacOS 10.13.3
* OnePlus 3T w/ Android Oreo, API 26

### Special Notes
Depending on the resolution of the target
device, the maze may initially not fit the
display properly.  This can be remedied by
modifying the MAZE_ROWS and MAZE_COLS
variables in MazeActivity.java to appropriate
values
